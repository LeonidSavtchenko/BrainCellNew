Welcome to **BRAINCELL 1.0**, your gateway to understanding the intricate world of brain cells. This cutting-edge software empowers researchers, neuroscientists, and medical professionals to explore the brain's inner workings, reactions to stimuli, and responses to treatments. With **BRAINCELL 1.0**, you can create lifelike simulations of neurons and astrocytes with nano-geometry precision, faithfully replicating the brain's complex dynamics.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Cell Models**: Create detailed simulations of individual neurons and astrocytes with nano-geometry accuracy.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust membrane capacitance, ion conductance, synaptic strength, and more, observing how these changes affect cell behavior.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for both seasoned researchers and newcomers, our software is easy to use and offers extensive customization options.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Our user manual covers installation, setup, simulation creation, and result analysis to help you get started.
- **Ongoing Support**: We're committed to assisting you in unlocking new insights into brain function.

## Building Realistic Cell Models
When building a realistic cell model, consider the following essential elements:
1. **Cell Processes**: Import a 3D reconstructed tree of main cell processes from [neuromorpho.org](https://neuromorpho.org/) or generate artificial cell arbors.
2. **Astrocyte Nanostructures**: Reconstruct nanoscopic astroglial processes for statistical properties.
3. **Neuron Nanostructures**: Our software automatically generates synaptic spines with customizable parameters.
4. **Tissue Volume Fraction**: Determine the volume fraction occupied by astroglia and neurons, considering radial distribution from the soma.
5. **Membrane Surface Density**: Utilize 3D reconstructions of nanoscopic processes.
6. **Functional Data**: Include data like I-V curves, electrical responses, and intracellular calcium wave speed.

## Installation
**BRAINCELL** requires the following:
- Basic languages: C++, PYTHON (not older than 2013), and Neuron 7.0.
- Platform: Linux or Windows.
- Operation type: Sequential and parallel (MPI) computing.

## Setting Up and Running BRAINCELL
### 1. Constructing Cell Morphology (Nano-geometry)
- Import the 3D main-branch morphology of cells from [neuromorpho.org](https://neuromorpho.org/).
- Generate nanoscopic cell protrusions within the NEURON environment.

### 2. NEURON-Based Simulations of Membrane Mechanisms
- Refine cell morphology based on volumetric data.
- Populate cells with membrane mechanisms.
- Configure simulations and protocols.

### 3. Simulating Ionic Dynamics
- Design and simulate intracellular and extracellular ionic dynamics.
- Use cluster/cloud-based parallel computing for longer-term simulations.
