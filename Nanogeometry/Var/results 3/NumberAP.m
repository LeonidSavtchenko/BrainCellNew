% The code you provided has a few issues. Here's the corrected version:

% ```matlab
close all;
clear;

myFolder = pwd; % or 'C:\Users\yourUserName\Documents\My Pictures' or whatever...
% Check to make sure that folder actually exists. Warn user if it doesn't.
if ~isdir(myFolder)
    errorMessage = sprintf('Error: The following folder does not exist:\n%s', myFolder);
    uiwait(warndlg(errorMessage));
    return;
end

% Get a list of all files in the folder with the desired file name pattern.
filePattern = fullfile(myFolder, 'aps*.txt'); % Change to whatever pattern you need.
theFiles = dir(filePattern);
NumberOfFiles = length(theFiles);

startLine = 8;
data = zeros(NumberOfFiles, 1); % Store the number of data points for each file

for K = 1:NumberOfFiles
    baseFileName = theFiles(K).name;
    fullFileName = fullfile(myFolder, baseFileName);
    fprintf(1, 'Now reading %s\n', fullFileName);
    
    fileID = fopen(fullFileName, 'r');
    
    % Skip lines until reaching the desired starting line
    for i = 1:startLine-1
        fgetl(fileID);
    end
    
    % Read the remaining lines and store the data
    fileData = textscan(fileID, '%f');
    
    % Close the file
    fclose(fileID);
    
    % Extract the data from the cell array and store the number of data points
    data(K) = length(fileData{1});
end

disp(data); % Display the number of data points for each file
% ```
% 
% In this corrected version, the changes made include:
% 1. Preallocate the `data` array to the correct size (`NumberOfFiles`) to store the number of data points for each file.
% 2. Instead of overwriting the `data` variable in each iteration, create a temporary variable (`fileData`) to store the data read from each file.
% 3. Store the length of `fileData{1}` (the number of data points in each file) in the `data` array for each iteration.
% 4. Finally, display the `data` array to show the number of data points for each file.
% 
% Please note that this code assumes that the files in the folder match the specified file pattern and that the files are in the correct format for reading the data.
